        <p>THE cat went here and there 
            And the moon spun round like a top, 
            And the nearest kin of the moon, 
            The creeping cat, looked up. 
            Black Minnaloushe stared at the moon, 
            For, wander and wail as he would, 
            The pure cold light in the sky 
            Troubled his animal blood.
        </p>
        <p>Minnaloushe runs in the grass 
            Lifting his delicate feet. 
            Do you dance, Minnaloushe, do you dance? 
            When two close kindred meet. 
            What better than call a dance? 
            Maybe the moon may learn, 
            Tired of that courtly fashion, 
            A new dance turn. 
        </p>
        <p>Minnaloushe creeps through the grass 
            From moonlit place to place, 
            The sacred moon overhead 
            Has taken a new phase. 
        </p>
        <p>Does Minnaloushe know that his pupils 
            Will pass from change to change, 
            And that from round to crescent, 
            From crescent to round they range? 
            Minnaloushe creeps through the grass 
            Alone, important and wise, And lifts to the changing moon 
            His changing eyes.  
        </p>
        <p>~ William Butler Yeats</p>
