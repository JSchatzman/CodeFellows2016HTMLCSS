                <p>THE cat went here and there</p>
                <p>And the moon spun round like a top,</p> 
                <p>And the nearest kin of the moon,</p> 
                <p>The creeping cat, looked up.</p> 
                <p>Black Minnaloushe stared at the moon,</p> 
                <p>For, wander and wail as he would,</p> 
                <p>The pure cold light in the sky</p> 
                <p>Troubled his animal blood.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Minnaloushe runs in the grass</p> 
                <p>Lifting his delicate feet.</p> 
                <p>Do you dance, Minnaloushe, do you dance?</p> 
                <p>When two close kindred meet.</p> 
                <p>What better than call a dance?</p>
                <p>Maybe the moon may learn,</p> 
                <p>Tired of that courtly fashion,</p> 
                <p>A new dance turn.</p> 
                <br>
                <p>Minnaloushe creeps through the grass</p> 
                <p>From moonlit place to place,</p> 
                <p>The sacred moon overhead</p> 
                <p>Has taken a new phase.</p> 
                <br>
                <p>Does Minnaloushe know that his pupils</p> 
                <p>Will pass from change to change,</p> 
                <p>And that from round to crescent,</p> 
                <p>From crescent to round they range?</p> 
                <p>Minnaloushe creeps through the grass</p> 
                <p>Alone, important and wise, And lifts to the changing moon</p> 
                <p>His changing eyes.</p>
