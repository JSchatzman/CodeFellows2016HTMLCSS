# CodeFellows2016HTMLCSS

### By Jordan Schatzman

####The link to the website can be found [here](https://codefellows2016cats-jds.herokuapp.com/home.html)  My cat website is composed of three html files, contact.html, home.html and about.html.  The html documents consist of standard html tagging like div, head, span, p, body, etc.The many classes and IDs can be found in the styles.css file.  This file utilizes flexboxes extensibly to handle grids and figure.  For deployment purposes, I have included an index.php file for automatic redirection to the html files.  For me, this part of the assessment required the most time and I was forced to learn and relearn a great deal of CSS.
