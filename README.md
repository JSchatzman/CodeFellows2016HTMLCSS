##### My cat website is composed of three html files, contact.html, home.html and about.html.  The html documents consist of standard html tagging like div, head, span, p, body, etc.
##### The many classes and IDs can be found in the styles.css file.  This file utilizes flexboxes extensibly.  For me, this part of the assessment required the most time and I was forced to
